# Visual Content Generation Context Fidelity Fixes

## Issue Summary
Visual content generation was producing generic/irrelevant images instead of contextually relevant ones for specific businesses. For example, liatvictoriaphotography.co.uk was generating railroad track images instead of photography-related visuals.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Context Dilution in Prompt Generation
- **Problem**: Generic prompt templates dominated business-specific context
- **Location**: `_create_campaign_aware_prompt()` in `adk_visual_agents.py`
- **Issue**: Started with generic "Create a professional marketing image for: {post_content}" rather than business-specific context

### 2. Inadequate Industry Detection
- **Problem**: Limited industry patterns in business analysis
- **Location**: `_generate_enhanced_mock_analysis()` in `business_analysis_agent.py`
- **Issue**: Only detected "tech" industry, everything else became "Professional Services"

### 3. Missing Business Context Propagation
- **Problem**: Business context from URL analysis didn't effectively flow to visual generation
- **Location**: Multiple agents in the pipeline
- **Issue**: Campaign guidance wasn't properly extracted from business context

## Implemented Fixes

### Fix 1: Enhanced Business-Specific Prompt Generation

**File**: `/backend/agents/adk_visual_agents.py`
**Method**: `_create_campaign_aware_prompt()`

**Changes**:
- **Industry-First Approach**: Start with business-specific context instead of generic post content
- **Specific Industry Templates**: 
  - Photography: "Professional photography portfolio image showcasing {company}'s photography services"
  - Art/Design: "Creative artistic portfolio image showcasing {company}'s artistic work"
  - Food/Restaurant: "Appetizing food photography showcasing {company}'s culinary offerings"
  - Fitness: "Active lifestyle photography showcasing {company}'s fitness approach"
  - Technology: "Modern technology imagery showcasing {company}'s digital solutions"
- **Product Context Integration**: Utilize `product_context`, `visual_themes`, and `brand_personality`
- **Industry-Specific Requirements**: Add detailed visual requirements for each industry

**Example Output**:
- **Before**: "Create a professional marketing image for: Showcasing our latest portfolio additions"
- **After**: "Professional photography portfolio image showcasing Liat Victoria Photography's photography services and style, featuring portrait photography, incorporating themes of creativity, artistry, moments. Show photographer with professional equipment, beautiful composed shots, or stunning photo examples."

### Fix 2: Comprehensive Industry Detection

**File**: `/backend/agents/business_analysis_agent.py`
**Method**: `_generate_enhanced_mock_analysis()`

**Changes**:
- **Expanded Industry Patterns**: Added detection for:
  - Photography: `['photography', 'photographer', 'photo', 'wedding', 'portrait', 'studio']`
  - Art & Design: `['art', 'artist', 'design', 'creative', 'gallery', 'artwork']`
  - Food & Dining: `['restaurant', 'food', 'dining', 'chef', 'cuisine', 'menu']`

  - Fashion & Apparel: `['fashion', 'clothing', 'apparel', 'style', 'boutique']`
  - Business Consulting: `['consulting', 'consultant', 'advisory', 'business', 'strategy']`
- **Industry-Specific Context**: Each industry gets tailored business description, target audience, visual themes, and creative direction
- **Better Fallback**: Even generic businesses get improved context

### Fix 3: Enhanced Campaign Guidance Flow

**File**: `/backend/agents/adk_visual_agents.py`
**Method**: `generate_visual_content_for_posts()`

**Changes**:
- **Business Context Integration**: Extract campaign guidance from business context if missing
- **Visual Requirements**: Add industry-specific visual requirements to business context
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging of context flow
- **Context Validation**: Ensure all necessary context reaches visual generation

### Fix 4: Improved Video Prompt Generation

**File**: `/backend/agents/adk_visual_agents.py`

**Changes**:
- **Consistent Approach**: Apply same business-first approach to video generation
- **Industry-Specific Video Templates**: Tailored video concepts for each industry
- **Action-Oriented Prompts**: Focus on showing services/products in action

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Case 1: Photography Business (Primary Use Case)
**URL**: `liatvictoriaphotography.co.uk`
**Expected Behavior**:
- Industry detected as "Photography"
- Visual prompts should include: photographer equipment, portfolio shots, creative process
- Should NOT generate: railroad tracks, generic business imagery
- Campaign guidance should emphasize artistic vision and technical expertise

### Test Case 2: Restaurant Business
**URL**: Any restaurant website
**Expected Behavior**:
- Industry detected as "Food & Dining"  
- Visual prompts should include: food preparation, dining atmosphere, delicious dishes
- Campaign guidance should emphasize culinary excellence and hospitality

### Test Case 3: Fitness Business  
**URL**: Any gym/fitness website
**Expected Behavior**:
- Industry detected as "Fitness & Wellness"
- Visual prompts should include: people exercising, training sessions, healthy lifestyle
- Campaign guidance should emphasize transformation and energy

## Validation Points

### 1. Industry Detection Validation
```bash
# Check if photography URLs are properly detected
# Look for log entries: "‚úÖ REAL AI ANALYSIS: Industry: Photography"
```

### 2. Prompt Generation Validation
```bash
# Check if business-specific prompts are generated
# Look for log entries starting with industry-specific templates
# Example: "Professional photography portfolio image showcasing..."
```

### 3. Context Flow Validation
```bash
# Check if campaign guidance flows properly
# Look for log entries: "üìã Enhanced campaign guidance with business context: X fields"
# Look for log entries: "üé® Product visual themes: [...]"
```

## Expected Improvements

### For Photography Businesses:
- **Before**: Railroad tracks, generic business imagery, corporate stock photos
- **After**: Photographer with camera, beautiful portrait examples, artistic composition, behind-the-scenes shots

### For Restaurants:
- **Before**: Generic business settings, office imagery
- **After**: Delicious food close-ups, chef in action, dining atmosphere, satisfied customers

### For Fitness Businesses:
- **Before**: Generic professional imagery
- **After**: People working out, gym equipment, active lifestyle, transformation stories

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Key Log Messages to Monitor:
1. `üîç Enhanced business context - Company: X, Industry: Y`
2. `üé® Product visual themes: [...]`
3. `üìã Final campaign guidance keys: [...]`
4. Industry-specific prompt starts: `Professional photography portfolio image...`

### Common Issues to Watch:
1. **Generic Fallback**: If still seeing generic prompts, check industry detection patterns
2. **Missing Context**: If campaign guidance is empty, check business context extraction
3. **Incorrect Industry**: If wrong industry detected, add more specific URL patterns

## File Changes Summary

1. **`/backend/agents/adk_visual_agents.py`**:
   - Enhanced `_create_campaign_aware_prompt()` with business-first approach
   - Enhanced `_create_campaign_aware_video_prompt()` with consistent approach  
   - Enhanced `generate_visual_content_for_posts()` with better context integration

2. **`/backend/agents/business_analysis_agent.py`**:

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Photography businesses** generate photography-related imagery (cameras, portfolios, artistic shots)
‚úÖ **Restaurant businesses** generate food-related imagery (dishes, dining, kitchen)  
‚úÖ **Fitness businesses** generate fitness-related imagery (workouts, equipment, active lifestyle)
‚úÖ **No more generic/irrelevant imagery** for specific business types
‚úÖ **Better context flow** from URL analysis to visual generation
‚úÖ **Improved logging and debugging** for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy these changes and test with liatvictoriaphotography.co.uk
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for the new log messages to ensure context flows properly
3. **Validate Results**: Check that generated images are contextually relevant
4. **Fine-tune**: Adjust industry patterns or prompt templates based on results
5. **Expand Coverage**: Add more industry-specific patterns as needed

The fixes address the root cause of context dilution by prioritizing business-specific context over generic content, ensuring that visual generation accurately reflects the analyzed business and its industry.
