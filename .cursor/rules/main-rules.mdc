use makefiles for application operations, running, testing and similar.

Read the documentation and readme files to understand the solution architecture and solution intent before proceeding with any further additional code improvements or functional extensions to the solution.

the app is on port 8080. ensure this is consistent and well documented.

use system 'date' command to ascertain the latest datetime before writing date stamps into any files 

always review the documentation first and evaluate the solution maturity and completeness. 

assess if the functionality and features have been implemented sucessfully by running the appropriate, relevant tests. 

Mark the TODO/EPIC activities as done once relevant features/functioanltiy has been implemented

Commit and push once the testing and documentation  update tasks are performed

We are working towards MVP grade solution. 

ensure you regularly test and validate the solution architecture, before committing and pushing the changes to github

do not use stubs or mock data, as we target a functionally complete solution capability

use python3

Target production state would be a Hosted-on Google Cloud platform. Consider that in the longer solution maturity roadmpa post MVP.

**SUBMISSION COMPLETENESS OVER NEW FEATURES**
   - Focus on polishing existing complete functionality
   - No new major features - only submission-critical improvements
   - Maintain current working state - no breaking changes
   - Document first, then implement minimal changes

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS COMPLIANCE**
   - Google ADK Framework 1.0.0+ 
   - Multi-agent system 
   - Sequential workflow pattern 
   - Production-ready code 
   - Clean, well-documented codebase
