# Project Management Documentation

**Author: JP + 2025-06-15**

## Purpose

This folder contains project management documentation to track the development progress of the AI Marketing Campaign Post Generator marketing campaign generator. The solution is currently at POC maturity level and intended to be runnable with Makefile targets following the 2 Musketeers pattern.

## Structure

- `TODO.md` - Detailed checklist of specific tasks and implementation items
- `EPIC.md` - High-level feature epics and major functionality blocks
- `ROADMAP.md` - Production maturity roadmap and deployment considerations
- `Visual-Cues.md` - Bug analysis and documentation for AI processing visual feedback issues
- `Video-Content-Generation.md` - Critical video preview functionality requirements and fixes needed

## Current Maturity State

**POC (Proof of Concept)** - Basic functionality demonstrated with mocked AI integration

### Completion Status: ~30%

- ✅ Frontend UI flow complete
- ✅ Basic React context state management
- ✅ Happy path testing framework
- ❌ AI integration (currently mocked)
- ❌ Backend-frontend integration
- ❌ Persistent data storage
- ❌ Production deployment setup
- ❌ Comprehensive testing suite

## How to Use

1. Review `EPIC.md` for high-level feature status
2. Check `TODO.md` for specific implementation tasks
3. Mark items as complete by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
4. Update completion percentages as features are implemented
5. Commit progress updates to track development velocity

## Next Steps

Focus should be on integrating the Python ADK backend with the React frontend to replace mocked AI functionality and establish a proper data persistence layer.
